This project is cool!

## Build & development



you should have installed nodeJs. Just go to www.nodejs.org and download the one for the os you are using and then add it to the path.

`cd <folder_name>`

`npm install`

`bower install`

`npm install -g grunt grunt-cli`

Run  `grunt serve` to run the application in the browser.

This one has live reload so when u make a change in the code you immediately see the changes. You don't need to manually reload the application.


Adele could your mum like be a little bit more specific on what she wants exactly? It would make things faster.

So we work on what she wants as a minimim viable product and then add the rest later.

But I will begin the work on the management system today. Just get to the UI and do ya thing

Good Luck guys.

Cheers!
